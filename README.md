# Wallpaper_Sorter

For now how to run:
install flask: `pip install flask`
install flaskr (the demo app): `pip install editable .` at the top level

Setup some environment variables and the database
```python
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_DEBUG=true
flask initdb
```

Now it should be good to run with `flask run`
